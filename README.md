Assignment 2 focused on regression models to predict the closing price of AAPL based on historical data.<br>

The Jupyter notebook in this repo is the notebook I submitted to be graded. The notebook is a guided application of the entire Machine Learning pipeline from Data Selection and  Data Cleaning, to Model training, verification, and graphing.<br>

The end result was that I built 4 regression models using a variety of tools.
